Choreo.fi Idea.

Dancing is a hobby of mine. I always find it difficult to remember what dance move I should be transitioning to while I'm freestyling. My app will work like anki and notify me at random intervals to do a next dance move. 
If I have time, I'll add spotify integration into the app so that I can listen to my favorite songs while practicing.
